The Software Notability is a note-taking app that allows me to take daily notes. The user interface is easy to navigate. What I like about the software is that it allows me to simply create folders for each subject, which helps me keep organized. One notable feature is the audio recording function, which syncs with the notes. The app also allows you to convert handwritten notes to text. The software lets you change fonts and backgrounds and select from over a hundred templates. The software allows you to share notes via email and turns written assignments into PDFs, making them much easier to submit. Another feature is that you can use Notability on your phone or laptop, and your notes instantly sync throughout your devices.

Software design is crucial because it provides a structure for creating effective and successful software. Well-designed software has a lag-free, smooth user interface and allows for quick updates and bug fixes without interfering with the performance of the entire program.
A well-structured design converts user requirements into a logical plan, resulting in well-designed software that reduces the time spent building and maintaining the program. Well-maintained software also helps the user navigate and stay organized. Good design also enhances quality assurance and creates software that is more dependable by identifying potential issues early in the development process. It encourages the development of a user-friendly platform, ensuring that the final product meets the requirements and preferences of the users.
